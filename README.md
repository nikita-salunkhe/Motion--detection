# Motion-detection

### Introduction
The algorithm presents detection of moving objects from a static background scene based on frame differencing method. 
Any motion detection system based on frame differencing needs to handle a number of critical situations such as: 
• Image noise, due to a poor quality image source;
• Small movements of non-static objects such as tree branches and bushes blowing in the wind; 

The main objective of the present research is to develop an algorithm that can handle the critical situations, and hence can used further to find location and velocity calculation of object.
